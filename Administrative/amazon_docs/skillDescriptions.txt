Short skill description: 
A quick-reference for Dungeons and Dragons 5e.

-------------------------------------------------

Full skill description:
Ask the DM is a quick reference tool for use with Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition. Designed for use around the table during sessions, Ask the DM aims to reduce the amount of time spent looking up information.

There's two ways you can use this skill:
1) Fast mode answers a single question. Example: 'Alexa, Ask the DM what is the range of fireball?'
2) Interactive mode starts a session where you can ask as many questions as you like (say quit to exit). Example: 'Alexa, open Ask the DM,' listen to the prompt, then 'What is fireball?'

You can ask things like 'what is fireball' to get a summary description (Warning! Some descriptions are LONG).

To speed things up, you can ask things like 'how much does a backpack cost?' or 'what is level 3 of exhaustion?' and get a quick answer. To get answers for specific information, include the name of the spell, item, feat, or condition; as well as an attribute such as range, spell type, description, level, prerequisite, etc. For an exhaustive list of what you can ask about, please see the features list below or say 'help'.

Quick note on functionality - Alexa understands you better in interactive mode. This is due to how Amazon figures out what you're saying. If you're having trouble getting info on a spell or item, try interactive mode first!
