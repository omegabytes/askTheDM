Ask the DM is a quick-reference tool designed for use during Dungeons and Dragons play sessions. The skill provides spell descriptions to players through a voice-command interface.

The core skill is a simple question-and-answer session. Users can get full spell descriptions, short descriptions, or single spell attributes such as casting time or range. Users can ask questions about items, feats, and conditions, as well as find the pages this information is found on. Users may also roll game dice, and roll 20-sided die with advantage or disadvantage. An itemized list of features is found in the [changelog.](CHANGELOG.md)

If you'd like to get involved, please check out [our contributing document.](https://github.com/omegabytes/askTheDM/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
